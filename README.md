# SpellChecker with Auto-Complete
This SpellChecker with Auto-Complete project is a C++ implementation of a spell checking and auto-complete feature. It utilizes the Trie data structure to efficiently store a dictionary of words and provides functionality to identify misspelled words and suggest the best replacements. Additionally, it includes an auto-complete feature that suggests words based on a given prefix.

Features
Spell Checking:
Given a string input, the project identifies misspelled words by comparing them against a dictionary of words stored in a Trie. It provides suggestions for the best replacements for each misspelled word.

Auto-Complete:
The project offers an auto-complete feature that suggests words based on a given prefix. It efficiently traverses the Trie to find all possible words starting with the provided prefix.

Optimized Storage:
The project optimizes storage by caching previous search results, reducing the time complexity for subsequent searches for the same prefix.

User-Friendly Interface:
The project provides a user-friendly command-line interface where users can enter a string, and the program performs the spell check and auto-complete operations, providing the corrected string as the output.
